Airport Challenge
=================

One of our clients has requested us to design and develop software which will help in managing planes at an airport. Here is a summary of the requirement:

a) Air traffic controller should be able to

  instruct an incoming plane to land, provided

    weather is not stormy
    airport has spare landing space (airport not full)

  instruct a plane to take off, provided
    weather is not stormy
    So that all planes land and take off safely, the air traffic controller will make sure

    allow a plane takes of from the airport where it is located currently

    check plane's status and
    allow only planes with status 'flying' to land,
    and planes with status 'landed' to take off

b) Plane should report their status

  as flying
  at airport

c) Airports should have following

  default airport capacity can be overridden

I plan to start rspec test first and then on to code with above specs.

Will, update README as I make further progress

PS - Sorry for the delay, as was extremely tied up with some personal matter
